Vizontele is not only a comedy film, but also a social commentary on the changes and challenges that Turkey faced in the 1970s. The film shows how television brought new perspectives and possibilities to a remote and isolated village, but also how it exposed them to the harsh realities of the outside world. The film also reflects on the political and cultural conflicts that divided Turkish society at the time, such as secularism versus religion, modernity versus tradition, democracy versus authoritarianism, nationalism versus socialism, and Turkish versus Kurdish identity.
