# SoundSpot Evade: A Frequency Based Volume Shaper Plug-in
 
SoundSpot Evade is a volume shaping FX plug-in for Mac OSX and Windows that grants the user surgical control over the audio signal by utilising frequency determined volume shaping. The benefit of a frequency based volume shaping plug-in is that you can create space in the mix by volume ducking only problem frequencies as opposed to the entire audio signal. This result is a more controlled and natural sounding mix, which is preferred by most genres outside of electronic music.
 
However this doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t mean the Evade volume shaper canÃ¢Â€Â™t be useful for electronic music production tasks, as the plug-in can still deliver conventional volume shaping in just a few clicks and also comes with a nifty mid/side balance control and unlinked start and end points which is extremely useful for audio that needs to duck but still retain a transient snap to cut through the mix.

## How to use Evade
 
Using Evade is very simple and intuitive. You can start by selecting one of the presets from the drop-down menu or create your own custom envelope shape by dragging the nodes on the main display. You can also adjust the time syncing, smoothing, phase shift and pulse width modulation parameters to fine-tune the envelope shape. You can switch between the frequency spectrum and the moving wave display modes by clicking on the button at the top right corner of the main display.
 
Next, you can select the frequency range that you want to apply the volume shaping to by using the multi-band selector at the bottom of the plug-in. You can also adjust the mid/side balance to control how much volume shaping is applied to the mid and side channels of the audio signal. You can also flip the envelope playback direction by clicking on the button at the bottom left corner of the plug-in.
 
Finally, you can bypass the plug-in by clicking on the power button at the top left corner of the plug-in or use the mix knob to blend between the dry and wet signals. You can also save your own presets by clicking on the save button next to the preset menu.
 
## Why use Evade
 
Evade is a versatile and powerful volume shaping tool that can be used for various purposes such as sidechain compression, ducking, gating, tremolo, stutter and more. By using frequency based volume shaping, you can achieve more precise and natural sounding results than using a conventional volume shaper that affects the entire audio signal. You can also create dynamic and rhythmic effects by syncing the envelope shape to the tempo of your project or using different time divisions.
 
Evade is also very easy to use and has a sleek and modern user interface that allows you to quickly and easily adjust all the parameters and see how they affect the audio signal. You can also choose from a variety of presets that cover different genres and styles or create your own custom shapes with unlimited nodes. Evade is a must-have plug-in for any producer or engineer who wants to add some movement and energy to their mixes.
