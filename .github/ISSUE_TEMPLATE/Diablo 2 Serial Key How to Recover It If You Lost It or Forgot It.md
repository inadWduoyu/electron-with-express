Diablo II (2000) is a classic action role-playing game developed by Blizzard Entertainment.

Here are some ways to find your Diablo II (2000) serial key.

## Method 2: Use a Key Generator
 
A key generator is a software that can create random serial keys for various games, including Diablo II (2000). However, this method is not recommended for several reasons:

- It is illegal and violates Blizzard's terms of service.
- It may not work or may generate invalid keys.
- It may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
- It may result in your account being banned or suspended by Blizzard.

Therefore, use a key generator at your own risk and only as a last resort. You can find some key generators online, such as [this one](https://pastebin.com/tM8HYx23), but be careful of what you download and run on your computer.
 
## Method 3: Buy a New Key
 
If you don't have access to your original serial key and you don't want to use a key generator, you can always buy a new key from an authorized retailer. You can buy Diablo II (2000) from Blizzard's online store for $9.99 USD, or you can buy Diablo II: Resurrected, which is the remastered edition of the game that includes the Lord of Destruction expansion and improved graphics. You can buy Diablo II: Resurrected from [G2A](https://www.g2a.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-pc-battlenet-key-global-i10000255825001) for $39.99 USD. Either way, you will receive a new serial key that you can use to install and play the game.

Diablo II (2000) is a timeless game that many fans still enjoy today. However, if you have lost your serial key or you don't have the original CD anymore, you may have trouble installing and playing the game. Fortunately, there are some ways to find your serial key, such as checking your Battle.net account, using a key generator, or buying a new key.
