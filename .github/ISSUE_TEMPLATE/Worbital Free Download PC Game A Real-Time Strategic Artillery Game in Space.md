## Gameplay of Worbital
 
Worbital is a game that requires strategy, timing, and skill to win. You start by choosing a faction from four different civilizations: The Celestials, The Militia, The Dark Legion, or The Consortium. Each faction has its own unique weapons, abilities, and aesthetics.
 
Then you enter a match with up to three other players or AI opponents. Each player controls a planet that orbits around a star or another planet. You can build support structures and weapons on your planet to defend yourself and attack others. You can also upgrade your weapons and structures to make them more powerful or efficient.
 
The goal of the game is to be the last civilization standing. You can do this by destroying enemy planets with your weapons or by causing chain reactions that trigger cosmic events. For example, you can make a planet crash into another planet or into the sun, causing them to explode. You can also make the sun go supernova or create a black hole that sucks everything in.
